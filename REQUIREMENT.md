In the context of a waterfall model, the development process follows a sequential structure where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. Here are the functional requirements for an Online Banking System based on the waterfall model:

# 1. Requirement Analysis Phase:
   - *User Authentication:*
     - User registration
       Allow users to register before using the banking system features.
       The users will be able to create his account after registering.
       At the same time the users create theit profile.
     - *User login*
     - The registered user will have an option login through his mail or username.
       The registered users must be able to login to the account.
       Allow the users to use multi-factor authentication involving PASSWORD AND OTP.
     - *Change Password*
       Allow the registered users to change password in case they forget the password durign LOGIN.
       Allow the users to change the password through a registered e mail.
       Allow users to solve the captcha during authentication to receive an e mail.
       
   - *User Profiles:
   - *Manage profile*
     Allow users add a secondary mail id after multi factor authentication.
     Add a profile picture.
     Allow users to set language preferences.
   - *Edit Profile*
     Allow users to change their registered address , phone number.
     Enable users to change their username if it is unique.
     
     

*2. System Design Phase:*
   - *User Interface:* Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with easy navigation, responsive layouts, and clear instructions.
   - *Account Management:* Enable users to create new accounts, view existing accounts, and link external accounts.
   - *Transaction Tracking:* Provide a dashboard for users to monitor their transaction history, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

*3. Implementation Phase:*
   - *Security Measures:* Implement encryption protocols, secure socket layer (SSL) for data transmission, and secure password storage.
   - *User Roles:* Define roles such as customer, administrator, and support staff, each with specific access levels and permissions.
   - *Transaction Processing:* Develop a real-time transaction processing system that handles transfers, payments, and account updates accurately.

*4. Testing Phase:*
   - *Usability Testing:* Verify the user interface for ease of use, responsiveness, and compatibility across various devices and browsers.
   - *Functional Testing:* Validate all features including login, account creation, fund transfers, bill payments, and user profile management.
   - *Security Testing:* Conduct thorough security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities, ensuring data protection.

*5. Deployment Phase:*
   - *Server Infrastructure:* Set up and configure the necessary servers, databases, and network components to host the online banking system.
   - *Data Migration:* Safely transfer existing customer data to the new system without data loss or corruption.
   - *User Training:* Provide user documentation and training resources to help customers understand and navigate the new system.

*6. Maintenance Phase:*
   - *Bug Fixes:* Address and resolve any issues, bugs, or glitches identified post-deployment.
   - *Regular Updates:* Implement updates to enhance security, fix vulnerabilities, and introduce new features based on customer feedback.
   - *User Support:* Provide ongoing customer support through various channels such as online help, chat, or a dedicated support center.

*7. Documentation Phase:*
   - *User Manuals:* Create comprehensive user manuals and guides for customers to understand the system's features and functionalities.
   - *Technical Documentation:* Prepare detailed technical documentation for developers, administrators, and support staff.

*8. Project Closure:*
   - *Evaluation:* Assess the success of the project in meeting the defined functional requirements and business goals.
   - *Lessons Learned:* Document the lessons learned during the development process for future projects.
   - *Handover:* Transition the system to operational teams and provide necessary training for system administrators and support staff.

In the waterfall model, each phase must be completed before moving to the next one, making it crucial to thoroughly define and document the functional requirements at the beginning to ensure a successful project outcome.
