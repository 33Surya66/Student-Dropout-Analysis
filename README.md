## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Student Dropout Analysis project developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon. This project aims to address the critical issue of student dropout rates in educational institutions by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.

---

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Analyze factors contributing to student dropout rates.
- Develop predictive models to identify students at risk of dropping out.
- Provide actionable insights to educational institutions for intervention strategies.

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transformation, and normalization of raw data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to understand the patterns and trends in student dropout data.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features to improve model performance.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Web Application: Deployment of a user-friendly interface for interactive data visualization and dropout prediction.
